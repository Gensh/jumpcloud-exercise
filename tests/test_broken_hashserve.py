- When launched, the application should wait for http connections.
- It should answer on the `PORT` specified in the `PORT` environment variable.
- It should support three endpoints:
    - A `POST` to `/hash` should accept a password.
      It should return a job identifier immediately.
      It should then wait 5 seconds and compute the password hash.
      The hashing algorithm should be SHA512.
    - A `GET` to `/hash` should accept a job identifier.
      It should return the base64 encoded password hash for the corresponding
      `POST` request.
    - A `GET` to `/stats` should accept no data.
      It should return a JSON data structure for the total hash requests since
      the server started and the average time of a hash request in milliseconds.
- The software should be able to process multiple connections simultaneously.
- The software should support a graceful shutdown request. Meaning, it should
  allow any in-flight password hashing to complete, reject any new requests,
  respond with a `200` and shutdown.
- No additional password requests should be allowed when shutdown is pending.
